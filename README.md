## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL database
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd todoflow
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # Database
   POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/todoflow"

   # Better Auth
   BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
   BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

   # App
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   # Push database schema
   npx drizzle-kit push

   # Create default admin and manager accounts
   node setup-accounts.js
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## User Roles & Permissions

TodoFlow implements a simplified ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) model with three user roles:

### Admin Role
- **View**: Can see all todos from all users (with creator names)
- **Create**: Cannot create todos
- **Update**: Cannot update todos
- **Delete**: Can delete any todo, regardless of status

### Manager Role
- **View**: Can see all todos from all users (with creator names)
- **Create**: Cannot create todos
- **Update**: Cannot update todos
- **Delete**: Cannot delete todos

### User Role (Default)
- **View**: Can only see their own todos
- **Create**: Can create todos
- **Update**: Can update their own todos
- **Delete**: Can only delete their own todos in draft state

## Testing Different Roles

### Default Test Accounts

The system comes with pre-configured test accounts:

**Admin Account**
- Email: `admin@todoflow.com`
- Password: Use any password when signing up

**Manager Account**
- Email: `manager@todoflow.com`
- Password: Use any password when signing up

### How to Test

1. **Test as Admin:**
   - Sign up with `admin@todoflow.com`
   - Create some tasks as a regular user first
   - Login as admin and notice the trash icon on all tasks
   - Try deleting tasks in any status

2. **Test as Manager:**
   - Open an incognito window or different browser
   - Sign up with `manager@todoflow.com`
   - Notice you can see all tasks with creator names
   - Observe that edit/delete buttons are hidden

3. **Test as Regular User:**
   - Sign up with any other email (e.g., `user@example.com`)
   - Create and manage your own tasks
   - Notice you only see your own tasks

### Email Verification Note

**Email verification is disabled for development** since email service providers require paid plans. Users can sign up and login immediately without email confirmation. In production, you would enable email verification through services like Resend or SendGrid.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Issues**
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- Check your `POSTGRES_URL` in `.env`
- Verify database exists and credentials are correct

**Role Permissions Not Working**
- Check if default accounts were created: `node setup-accounts.js`
- Verify user roles in database using Drizzle Studio
- Clear browser cache and refresh

**Build Errors**
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run build`
- Ensure environment variables are properly set
